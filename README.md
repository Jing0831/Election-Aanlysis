# Election-Aanlysis
We collected data for the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, with datasets containing data on U.S. county-level voting statistics, such as demographics, county information, and income, as well as COVID cases and deaths. We explore which factors may have influenced the choice of party in the presidential election by the following methods:
● Principal Components Analysis
● Factor Analysis
● Linear Regression
● K-Nearest Neighbor
● Cluster Analysis
● Decision tree Analysis
● Neural Networks
